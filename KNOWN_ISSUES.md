### Known Issues

#### Map

- If there is no offline style and the device is offline, an empty white screen shows [#379](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/379)
- If you open the app without an offline style, and then add a default offline
  style, the offline style may not appear until 5 minutes later on some phones
  (caching issues)
- Map "my location" blue dot sometimes appears behind observations [#432](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/432)
- Transparent circle around "my location" blue dot does not actually signify GPS
  accuracy. [#433](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/433)
- GPS pill in header somtimes does not update correctly (it shows "no gps" when there is, in fact, GPS) [#378](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/378)

#### Observation view

- There is no explanation of what the blue "lightning bolt" means or why you cannot edit an observation [#382](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/382)
- Sharing an observation does not work consistently when sharing with different apps [#380](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/380)

#### New/Edit Observation

- There is no way to add the name of person using the
  phone to an observation
- There is no way to stop the location of a new observation updating from the
  GPS except from saving the observation (e.g. the user needs to stay in the
  same location until they save the observation for the first time)
- In the "Details" questions, there is no way to exit without clicking through every question to the end [#383](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/383)
- Cancelling an edit should show "discard edits" not "discard observation" [#381](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/381)

#### Photos

- Sometimes photos will not rotate on a device with low memory [#353](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/353)
- There is no way to delete / remove a photo from an observation [#384](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/384)

#### Sync

- The progress indicator jumps backwards and forwards prior to
  completion (it does seem to sync eventually, even if sync progress is not
  reliable)
- Device name is random (user cannot change it)

#### Misc

- Switching quickly between two different installations of Mapeo on the same phone can cause an error. [#434](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-mobile/issues/434)
